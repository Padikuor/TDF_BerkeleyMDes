# Technology Design Foundations 
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ida. Welcome to my Technology Design Foundations journal. Think of this as a behind-the-scenes tour of my journey, fully loaded with projects, experiments, challenges, and plenty of iterations. Itâ€™s a mix of trial, error, and discovery, and Iâ€™m excited for you to explore what Iâ€™ve been building. Enjoy the ride! ðŸš€

## Week 1
#### Aug 28 2025

It's week one, we were given an Arduino Uno starter kit and we were asked to install the Arduino Software, Adobe Illustrator and Fusion 360. We were also required to complete the online laser cutting training.

## Week 2 
#### Sept 2 2025 -Sept 4 2025

It's the second week of TDF and we worked on printing "hello world" with an arduino.\
For our assignment we were asked to print hello world and also get 2 or more LEDs to blink in one program.
This was really fun even though I sort of did it overnight. Below is my work in pictures and videos. I'm new to github so hopefully I get some time over the weekend to organize my work and make it look nice!

### Electronics
Below I have several activities or iterations of my Arduino code to do different activities as stated below:
1. Printout Hello World
2. Hello World Printout and 1 blinking LED
3. Hello World Printout and Traffic Light Simulation (3 blinking LED simultaneously)
   
 #### Activity 1

#### Laser Cutting


#### Activity 1
Below I have various activities and concepts in pictures for my lasercut work. The earrings were a personal experiment. It wasn't perfect but I'm featuring here as part of my activities.

### Fabrication(3D Modeling and Printing)
We were asked to 3D print our rings. Below is a 3D printed version of my initial laser cut rings.
I used Fusion 360 to do the design and the Prusa slicer to get my G-code. I printed these in the makerspace on Prusa i3 MK3S 3D printer with a black filament. Maybe, I should have been more intentional about my colour coding.

## Week 4
#### Sept 16 2025 - Sept 18 2025

This week was a prequel to our first major assignment.

Sample Circuit Diagram


### Fabrication
We were to think through different origami designs with the contraints of 0-20 folds. I watched quite a number of Youtube videos. It was quite a challenge getting a good design with few folds. I decided to go with a boat design.


|<img width="975" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14bf0ee-05a5-4ed4-bb09-b27dfb93776f" />|  |<img width="975" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c656ed96-28d5-4b2d-9e9c-b06821178d59" />|



Trying out some boat designs


## Week 5
#### Sept 23 2025 - Sept 25 2025
The almighty Week 5 is here! It's the week we present our work on Emotive Origami. Unfortunately for me I found out I couldn't use the boat origami so I had to start conceptualizing from scratch. Here goes something!



### The Abstract Sculpture



##### 18th September 2025
### Ideation Stage

<img width="711" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e84a8e-78cc-40ee-b421-b5e4b16010e1" />


 
I started to conceptualize what I wanted to do looking at the time available. I decided to do a boat design with a horizontal displacement for starters and then add more complexity if time permits. I chose the horizontal motion because like the assignment instruction said, I wanted it to move a significant distance. For the electronics bit, I decided to go with a servo and ultrasonic sensor design. I hope I made the right choice!

### Fabrication


<img width="708" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea4d5a03-bc4d-4c0f-b7bc-260fe61e9295" />

I built different origami boats, with different shapes and heights but I settled for this structure because the midpoint was just right for the motion I wanted.



##### 19th September, 2025
### Electronics

 <img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24483678-21e5-4061-8346-04d2ae02561a" />
 

On this day, I wrote the code for my project. I had some bugs along the way but it finally worked out. I also sort of forgot the working mechanism of the ultrasonic sensor so initially, I was trying to trigger it via sound instead of distance, but I figured it out and was super glad my code worked and the servo moved when triggered.

<img width="535" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eaeb47b-0875-4fd9-b84b-167b49f9e701" />

A snapshot of the electronics circuit. This wasnâ€™t so difficult for me to do. 
Iâ€™m glad the code worked well as well.


##### 20th September, 2025
### Fabrication


<img width="507" height="393" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3b5359c-4c71-4386-bcce-5cee50dda8c1" />



Today I decided to printout some sacrificial servo arms. I noticed my 3D printing speed was normal instead of slow so they did not turn-out as smoothly as I wanted them. I did not even use them in the end but I am keeping them as part of the experience.

<img width="510" height="431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badce7fa-f762-4364-b760-dc0ce6299221" />

I wanted to use black foamboard for my casing however, I did not get some at the Jacobs store so I had to improvise and cover my box with black paper. I also used cardboard to create an internal structure to house the Arduino and breadboard. I cut out the portions for the servo and ultrasonic sensor as well.



##### 23rd September, 2025
### Fabrication
<img width="428" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028ba372-c239-4113-bea6-fd48f8fdffb6" />


I was told my boat was not abstract enough so I had to come up with a new origami. Now I wanted something really abstract. So I decided to do an abstract sculpture on a bamboo stick which could do a significant movement. This is the first version of my work. A little rough on the edges but hopefully I get time to improve it.

<img width="765" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a0c8a3-7218-4793-bc77-dd9db57753fa" />

I also designed a pattern to cut the foamboard however I realized we were not allowed to laser cut foamboard so I did not use this design.

I used Tinkercard to create an electrical/electronic  and schematic diagram of my work. 
To represent the connections and flow of current.



##### 24th September 2025

### Fabrication

<img width="709" height="656" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d4d9b19-1f5a-49e3-9a42-87cd9a065cd3" />


 
Itâ€™s one more day to presentation day and now I am being careful not to make too many changes because ultimately, I need my project to move. I decided to add a cover to my box. The cover became a hood which was interfering with my ultrasonic sensor readings so I had to cut off the edge.



##### 26th September, 2025
It's Demo day!

 <img width="693" height="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/937ff3df-f69c-4af1-af9c-5906b7371d29" />
 

Itâ€™s final demo day and we are ready! Itâ€™s too late to make changes now. 
This is a picture of my work before the demo.

During the demo, I got feedback that my servo motor was moving too fast. So I had to redo my code to ensure it moved gradually and slowly. And yeah, it worked!
