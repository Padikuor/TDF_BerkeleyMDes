# Technology Design Foundations 
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Technology Design Foundations journal. Think of this as a behind-the-scenes tour of my journey, fully loaded with projects, experiments, challenges, and plenty of iterations. Itâ€™s a mix of trial, error, and discovery, and Iâ€™m excited for you to explore what Iâ€™ve been building. Enjoy the ride! ðŸš€

## Week 1

It's week one, we were given an Arduino Uno starter kit and we were asked to install the Arduino Software, Adobe Illustrator and Fusion 360. We were also required to complete the online laser cutting training.

## Week 2   

It's the second week of TDF and we worked on printing "hello world" with an arduino.\
For our assignment we were asked to print hello world and also get 2 or more LEDs to blink in one program.
This was really fun even though I sort of did it overnight. Below is my work in pictures and videos. I'm new to github so hopefully I get some time over the weekend to organize my work and make it look nice!

### Electronics
Below I have several activities or iterations of my Arduino code to do different activities as stated below:
1. Printout Hello World
2. Hello World Printout and 1 blinking LED
3. Hello World Printout and Traffic Light Simulation (3 blinking LED simultaneously)
   
 #### Activity 1

### Laser Cutting


#### Activity 1
Below I have various activities and concepts in pictures for my lasercut work. The earrings were a personal experiment. It wasn't perfect but I'm featuring here as part of my activities.

Laser cut some earrings



## Week 3
In Week 3 we were given an assignment to use the potentiometer

### Fabrication(3D Modeling and Printing)
We were asked to 3D print our rings. Below is a 3D printed version of my initial laser cut rings.
I used Fusion 360 to do the design and the Prusa slicer to get my G-code. I printed these in the makerspace on Prusa i3 MK3S 3D printer with a black filament. Maybe, I should have been more intentional about my colour coding.

This is how my printouts came out
