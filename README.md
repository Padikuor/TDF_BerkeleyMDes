## Week 1 #
#### Aug 28 2025

It's week one, we were given an Arduino Uno starter kit and we were asked to install the Arduino Software, Adobe Illustrator and Fusion 360. We were also required to complete the online laser cutting training.

<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fe2df54-4186-4593-8b7e-d10eb55d233e" />



## Week 2 
#### Sept 2 2025 -Sept 4 2025

It's the second week of TDF and we worked on printing "hello world" with an arduino.\
For our assignment we were asked to print hello world and also get 2 or more LEDs to blink in one program.
This was really fun even though I sort of did it overnight. Below is my work in pictures and videos. I'm new to github so hopefully I get some time over the weekend to organize my work and make it look nice!

### Electronics
Below I have several activities or iterations of my Arduino code to do different activities as stated below:
1. Printout Hello World
2. Hello World Printout and 1 blinking LED
3. Hello World Printout and Traffic Light Simulation (3 blinking LED simultaneously)
   
 #### Activity 1

### Fabrication(3D Modeling and Printing)
We were asked to 3D print our rings. Below is a 3D printed version of my initial laser cut rings.
I used Fusion 360 to do the design and the Prusa slicer to get my G-code. I printed these in the makerspace on Prusa i3 MK3S 3D printer with a black filament. Maybe, I should have been more intentional about my colour coding.

## Week 4
#### Sept 16 2025 - Sept 18 2025

This week was a prequel to our first major assignment.

Sample Circuit Diagram


### Fabrication
We were to think through different origami designs with the contraints of 0-20 folds. I watched quite a number of Youtube videos. It was quite a challenge getting a good design with few folds. I decided to go with a boat design.


|<img width="975" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14bf0ee-05a5-4ed4-bb09-b27dfb93776f" />|  |<img width="975" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c656ed96-28d5-4b2d-9e9c-b06821178d59" />|



Trying out some boat designs


## Week 5 
#### Sept 23 2025 - Sept 25 2025
The almighty Week 5 is here! It's the week we present our work on Emotive Origami. Unfortunately for me I found out I couldn't use the boat origami so I had to start conceptualizing from scratch. Here goes something!



### The Abstract Sculpture



##### 18th September 2025
### Ideation Stage

<img width="711" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e84a8e-78cc-40ee-b421-b5e4b16010e1" />


 
I started to conceptualize what I wanted to do looking at the time available. I decided to do a boat design with a horizontal displacement for starters and then add more complexity if time permits. I chose the horizontal motion because like the assignment instruction said, I wanted it to move a significant distance. For the electronics bit, I decided to go with a servo and ultrasonic sensor design. I hope I made the right choice!

### Fabrication


<img width="708" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea4d5a03-bc4d-4c0f-b7bc-260fe61e9295" />

I built different origami boats, with different shapes and heights but I settled for this structure because the midpoint was just right for the motion I wanted.



##### 19th September, 2025
### Electronics

 <img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24483678-21e5-4061-8346-04d2ae02561a" />
 

On this day, I wrote the code for my project. I had some bugs along the way but it finally worked out. I also sort of forgot the working mechanism of the ultrasonic sensor so initially, I was trying to trigger it via sound instead of distance, but I figured it out and was super glad my code worked and the servo moved when triggered.

<img width="535" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eaeb47b-0875-4fd9-b84b-167b49f9e701" />

A snapshot of the electronics circuit. This wasn’t so difficult for me to do. 
I’m glad the code worked well as well.


##### 20th September, 2025
### Fabrication


<img width="507" height="393" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3b5359c-4c71-4386-bcce-5cee50dda8c1" />



Today I decided to printout some sacrificial servo arms. I noticed my 3D printing speed was normal instead of slow so they did not turn-out as smoothly as I wanted them. I did not even use them in the end but I am keeping them as part of the experience.

<img width="510" height="431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badce7fa-f762-4364-b760-dc0ce6299221" />

I wanted to use black foamboard for my casing however, I did not get some at the Jacobs store so I had to improvise and cover my box with black paper. I also used cardboard to create an internal structure to house the Arduino and breadboard. I cut out the portions for the servo and ultrasonic sensor as well.



##### 23rd September, 2025
### Fabrication
<img width="428" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028ba372-c239-4113-bea6-fd48f8fdffb6" />


I was told my boat was not abstract enough so I had to come up with a new origami. Now I wanted something really abstract. So I decided to do an abstract sculpture on a bamboo stick which could do a significant movement. This is the first version of my work. A little rough on the edges but hopefully I get time to improve it.

<img width="765" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a0c8a3-7218-4793-bc77-dd9db57753fa" />

I also designed a pattern to cut the foamboard however I realized we were not allowed to laser cut foamboard so I did not use this design.

I used Tinkercard to create an electrical/electronic  and schematic diagram of my work. 
To represent the connections and flow of current.



##### 24th September 2025

### Fabrication

<img width="709" height="656" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d4d9b19-1f5a-49e3-9a42-87cd9a065cd3" />


 
It’s one more day to presentation day and now I am being careful not to make too many changes because ultimately, I need my project to move. I decided to add a cover to my box. The cover became a hood which was interfering with my ultrasonic sensor readings so I had to cut off the edge.



##### 26th September, 2025
It's Demo day!

 <img width="693" height="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/937ff3df-f69c-4af1-af9c-5906b7371d29" />
 

It’s final demo day and we are ready! It’s too late to make changes now. 
This is a picture of my work before the demo.

During the demo, I got feedback that my servo motor was moving too fast. So I had to redo my code to ensure it moved gradually and slowly. And yeah, it worked!

## Week 6
#### Sept 28 2025 - Oct 4 2025

This week was a prequel to our second major assignment. 




### Electronics

I began my project with the electronics and coding section since it felt like the easiest part to start with.


#### Soldering the DC Motor


youtube.com/watch?v=1sJRUqIma3g&feature=youtu.be

Using a helpful YouTube tutorial by Dr Sudhu, I soldered cables to my DC motor — it turned out simpler than expected. I secured everything neatly with a cable tie.
 [Watch the demo on YouTube](youtube.com/watch?v=1sJRUqIma3g&feature=youtu.be)

#### Electronics Connection

I created and tested my circuit using an Arduino, motor driver, and DC motor setup.

<img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6fd1a8-9f33-4274-a8e3-dfff59e9bd07" />

#### System Behaviour & Diagrams
I mapped out how the entire system works from power input to motion output showing how each component interacts.

Flow process or concept

This interactive system explores the connection between computer vision and physical computing using p5.js, Arduino, and machine learning. In the p5 sketch, a computer vision model detects and identifies human ears in real time, marking them with yellow circles on the video feed. The program analyzes the ears’ movement. When the head tilts clockwise, it sends a command through the Web Serial API to the Arduino, causing a DC motor to rotate in the same direction; when the head tilts anticlockwise, the motor mirrors the motion. The system also maps the speed of head movement to the motor’s rotational speed, creating a seamless interaction where digital perception directly translates into mechanical response.

System Diagram









### Fabrication
For fabrication, I sketched my mechanical ideas and listed the materials I would need.
Materials and components list: plywood, glue, string, DC motor, Arduino Uno, motor driver, and laptop (for running P5 and Arduino code).


#### Mechanical Ideas
I explored different wheel and gear concepts, experimenting with shapes and motion before deciding what to prototype.

## Week 7
#### Oct 5 2025 - Oct 11 2025





### Electronics
This week was focused on refining my P5 sketch and Arduino code. Both were integrated to make the system responsive and interactive.


<img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9050fb47-3673-4bd8-b40b-1f735b7b279c" />

 Functional Block Diagram






### Fabrication
My initial concept idea was on creating a gear-based design, but the first prototype didn’t achieve the desired outcome and so I decided to pivot toward a simpler yet effective concept that I could refine and complete  within the limited period. I finalized on using two wheels and the double pulley system logic.

<img width="600" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aeb71da-5589-4da4-905e-9b0019fb1647" />

#### Iterations

My concept design had a horizontal layout but in order for the second moving object to be visible I decided to incline the layout, giving it a more conspicuous look


<img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7266f30b-8dcb-48db-a66c-b6a9792a08c6" />


String choices, options and iterations
I had to try out different strings to ensure my design worked flawlessly. I realized that the strings that had more tension and friction worked perfectly. I even noticed that using the knot to tie the string was not efficient because the tension in the string could reduce. I finally settled on using a cable tie to hold the string. I currently use the white or brown rope-like strings



   <img width="975" height="395" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8dbb784-d2e7-4282-8846-8c548a67d11c" />
   


Wood supports iteration




So initially, I placed my wood supports in the middle of my L-design however, it was obstructing my lower wheel from moving freely so I had to displace it to the edge.

<img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b73d21e9-23a5-446c-be69-2bf2fc0a572a" />

 
Some parts I designed and cut out but never used…. Tears!😢


<img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5fc9bf7-814d-4862-bd43-a7e289087767" />

## Week 8 
#### 12th October– 18th October


### Electronics


Project Brief:
The Ambient Display project explores how information can be communicated subtly through form, movement, sound, color, or light. Using an Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2, the device retrieves real-world data via web API calls and translates it into meaningful visual or physical feedback. The focus is on creating an aesthetically pleasing and interactive experience, individually or in pairs.
This week, the project was introduced, and I partnered with Paola Rodriguez. Together, we spent three days brainstorming and refining ideas.


<img width="775" height="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b437a5aa-213a-4a1d-b5f0-2a356b637de7" />



We spent 3 days coming up with ideas of what we wanted to do. Above you can find all the ideas we came up with.


<img width="639" height="585" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b16b94e1-8bf0-457d-b7f9-8aa506d5f6fb" />


By day 2 we narrowed down to an idea of a lamp with this kind of structural design. Receiving inspiration from from these similar designs


<img width="675" height="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c5fb721-6ee4-44d9-8447-b4af84f51425" />

That same week I soldered my Adafruit ESP32 V2 header pins
[Watch the soldering tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPec237T18U&feature=youtu.be)


This was based on Dr Sudhu’s tutorial above

I installed the ESP32 V2 drivers as described in this tutorial 
[Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2 Setup Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-feather-v2/arduino-ide-setup#install-esp32-board-support-package-3112219)

I also set up my ESP32 on the Berkeley IOT network

I completed a sample tutorial by my teaching assistant, Roopa on using the ESP32 with a weather API. This sample project allowed me to connect my ESP32s to WiFi, receive data about Jacobs Hall from a weather API endpoint, and display the temperature and wind speed through a simple ambient display.

Diagram of electronics connection


This week I connected the electronics components and made sure there was a complete correct circuit connection.

In this week also, I took some time to decide on which API I was going to use. I finally settled on using Wikipedia. I wrote the initial code which initially turned on all the lights at once but I iterated several times and came up with an led strip that turned on systematically, pixel by pixel.

Illustration of our physical design


This week we further developed our physical design with illustrations of how our product will look like and be assembled.

We also designed the shapes of the acrylic fins and tested the design by laser cutting the shapes on plywood. We had 10 shapes which we repeated 6 times making a total of 60 fins.


## Week 10

We cut out our test acrylic pieces to be sure they would look as expected.

We tested the acrylic piece under our phone’s torch light to be sure it could reflect and diffuse light as we expected.

This week we cut out our acrylic shapes and tested them on the upper base of our plywood with slots. We numbered them from 0-9

Our design had both clear and frosted acrylic pieces. So we spent a day sanding our ‘even numbered’ acrylic pieces to get the frosted look.

Paola frosted some acrylic as well and sanded all the edges to shape them well so they fit in the slots
