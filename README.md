# TDF_BerkeleyMDes  

## Week 2  

It's the second week of TDF and we worked on printing "hello world" with an arduino.\
For our assignment we were asked to print hello world and also get 2 or more LEDs to blink in one program.
This was really fun even though I sort of did it overnight. Below is my work. I'm new to github so hopefully I get some ttime over the weekend to organize my work and make it look nice!
